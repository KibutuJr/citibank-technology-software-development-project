# Citi ICG Technology Software Development Project

---

## **Project Overview**

This project is part of a Citi ICG Technology Software Development job project, designed to provide hands-on experience with tasks that a Technology Software Development team at Citi might perform. The project encompasses several key areas of financial technology, including loan management, credit risk assessment, and real-time stock market risk visualization.

The project is divided into three main components:

1. **Loan Management System State Diagram**  
2. **Credit Risk Proposal**  
3. **Stock Monitor Application with JavaFX**

Each component reflects tasks that real-world banks and financial institutions perform to improve internal processes, assess risk, and support data-driven decision-making.

## **1. Loan Management System State Diagram**

As part of the simulation, a **state diagram** was created using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to visually represent the loan management workflow. The diagram captures:

- The process of receiving, reviewing, and approving loans.  
- Decision points for credit checks and risk assessment.  
- Integration points for internal monitoring systems.  

You can access the **state diagram PDF** here: [Loan Management State Diagram (PDF)](app/resources/LoanManagementStateDiagram.pdf)

**Real-world impact:**  
- Provides clear visualization for stakeholders.  
- Helps identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the loan lifecycle.  
- Enhances communication between technical and non-technical teams.

## **2. Credit Risk Proposal**

The project included **researching machine learning solutions to assess credit risk** and providing recommendations for implementation. Key activities included:

- Reviewing potential ML models for predicting default risk.  
- Evaluating data sources and quality for accurate credit assessment.  
- Providing actionable recommendations for integrating AI-driven risk scoring into Citi’s internal systems.  

**Real-world impact:**  
- Supports proactive risk management.  
- Enables data-driven decision-making for credit approvals.  
- Reduces the likelihood of non-performing loans, increasing financial stability.

## **3. Stock Monitor Application with JavaFX**

The highlight of this project is a **Java-based stock monitor application** that queries the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from Yahoo Finance every five seconds and displays a live-updating line chart using JavaFX.  

### **Features:**
- Real-time stock price updates for DJIA.  
- Live line graph with time on the x-axis and stock price on the y-axis.  
- Historical data retained in memory to visualize trends across the session.  
- Built with **Java**, **Yahoo Finance API**, and **JavaFX** for frontend visualization.

**Real-world impact:**  
- Provides an accessible dashboard for non-technical employees to monitor market risk.  
- Enables banks to quickly assess market exposure and respond to volatility.  
- Lays the foundation for more advanced analytics and visualizations across multiple timeframes.

## **Key Skills Gained**

Through this project, several technical and professional skills were developed:

- **Java Programming:** Building robust backend tools and integrating APIs.  
- **API Development:** Querying real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance.  
- **Data Visualization:** Using JavaFX to create interactive, real-time charts.  
- **Backend Development:** Managing queues and real-time data storage.  
- **Frontend Development:** Creating intuitive interfaces for non-technical users.  
- **Machine Learning:** Researching ML models for credit risk assessment.  
- **Process Mapping & System Design:** Creating UML state diagrams for complex workflows.  
- **Risk Assessment:** Understanding financial risk monitoring and mitigation.  
- **Written Communication:** Documenting research and proposals clearly.

## **Learning Experience & Interview Insights**

Participating in this simulation provided valuable insights into working on a **Technology Software Development team at Citi**:

> "I recently participated in one of Citi's job projects, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Technology Software Development team at Citi.  
> I worked on several tasks to improve Citi's loan management system and stock market risk reporting. I practiced creating state diagrams to show loan management processes and researched machine learning solutions to assess credit risk. I was also able to apply my Java skills to build an internal tool to visualize stock market risk in a real-world context.  
> Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy applying my technical skills to improve internal processes. I'm excited to apply these skills on a Technology Software Development team at a company like Citi."
